"HDRS- Hindi Dialogue Restaurant Search", is a fully-labelled collection of human-human written conversations in an Indic language Hindi on the restaurant domain. This is the first attempt to provide a dialogue corpus on the Hindi language.
* This corpus is collected to promote research and development in the field of the Hindi dialogue system.
* Corpus consists of 1400 dialogues collected using the Wizard-of-Oz paradigm, divided into Training (800), Development (200) and Testing (400) parts.
* The corpus uses the details of 118 Indian restaurants in a city named [Allahabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allahabad).
